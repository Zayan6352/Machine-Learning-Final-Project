# MAchine-Learning-final-project-Diabetes-Diagnosis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing diabetes using a comprehensive dataset of health and demographic information. The notebook contains data preprocessing and initial steps towards building a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises health and demographic data of 100,000 individuals, including:

- Demographic information (age, gender, race)
- Health metrics (BMI, blood glucose level, HbA1c)
- Medical history (hypertension, heart disease)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking history)


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit_learn
- Streamlit

## The Project Overview

- Implemented machine learning models for diabetes prediction.
- Evaluated and compared different model performances.
